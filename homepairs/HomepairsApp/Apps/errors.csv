error string, description
'Incorrect fields', When there is an incorrect field.
'Multiple Accounts Detected', This isn't really an error you'll get ever, its more for my side.
'Multiple properties with same address found', If you try to edit a property and somehow it finds two properties with the same address then it sends this back. Really more for me
'Failed to create a Roopairs account', when it fails to create the roopairs account
'Failed to create a Homepairs account', when it fails to create a homepairs account
'Too many properties associated with tenant', You probably wont get this
'This email is associated with more than one pm', not an error you'll run into, more for me. its when i search for an account and somehow two accounts come back
'Invalid property', just when a property is invalid. 
'Property given already exists', when you try and create a property that already exists
'Appliance does not exist.', pretty self explanatory
'Property does not exist.', when you try and edit a property that doesn't exist but its mostly for me
'You are not the property owner', when you try and edit a property you don't own
['Unable to log in with provided credentials.'], when the username or password is wrong. its an array cuz you guys wanted that
SERVPRO_DOESNT_EXIST = 'Service provider does not exist.', when the service provider doesn't exist
